SUMMARY:

1. The purpose is to map incidents to agents based on three categories: "Service", "Contact type", and "First time fix".
2. The mapping process is sequential, and if the user doesn't specify a criterion, the value should be randomly assigned.
3. If, at any step, an incident doesn't meet the criteria, a random incident should be picked.
4. Once the incidents are filtered by the three classifications, a unique incident is picked and assigned to an agent, ensuring the incident hasn't been assigned to that agent before.
5. This entire sequence (filtering based on Service, Contact Type, First Time Fix, and selecting an incident) can be repeated multiple times for each agent.
6. The process is modular: there's repetitive logic, so the filtering process for the three categories should be a separate function. There should also be another function for the final incident selection.

DIVING IN:

1. Service Selection (X):

1.1 - From the total pool of incidents for the agent:
1.2 - If the user specified a service type from the UI, use that as "Service" X.
1.3 - If the user selected "RANDOM", randomly pick a "Service" from the available pool.
1.4 - Filter incidents for the agent by the chosen (1.1) or random (1.2) "Service" X and build an array from that, to pass on to step 2/Y.
1.5 - If no incidents match the chosen "Service":
1.5.1 - Remove the failed "Service" from the pool.
1.5.2 - Randomly select another "Service" from the remaining pool.
1.5.3 - Continue this process until incidents matching a "Service" are found or the pool is exhausted.
1.5.4 - If all services are exhausted and no incidents are found, log a warning indicating no more incidents are available for this agent and close the XYZM cycle for this agent.
1.6 - Pass the filtered list to the next step (Y).

2 - Contact Type Selection (Y):

2.1 - From the incidents filtered in step X:
2.2 - If the user specified a contact type from the UI, use that as "Contact type" Y.
2.3 - If the user selected "RANDOM", randomly pick a "Contact type" from the available pool.
2.4 - Filter incidents for the agent by the chosen (2.2) or random (2.3) "Contact type" Y and build an array from that, to pass on to step 3/Z.
2.5 - If no incidents match the chosen "Contact type":
2.5.1 - Remove the failed "Contact type" from the pool.
2.5.2 - Randomly select another "Contact type" from the remaining pool.
2.5.3 - Continue this process until incidents matching a "Contact type" are found or the pool is exhausted.
2.5.4 - If all "Contact types" are exhausted, revert to step X to select a new "Service".
2.6 - Pass the filtered list to the next step (Z).

3 - First Time Fix Selection (Z):

3.1 - From the incidents filtered in step Y:
3.2 - If the user specified a "First time fix" from the UI, use that as "First time fix" Z.
3.3 - If the user selected "RANDOM", randomly pick a "First time fix" from the available pool.
3.4 - Filter incidents for the agent by the chosen (3.2) or random (3.3) "First time fix" Z and build an array from that, to pass on to step 4/M.
3.5 - If no incidents match the chosen "First time fix":
3.5.1 - Remove the failed "First time fix" from the pool.
3.5.2 - Randomly select another "First time fix" from the remaining pool.
3.5.3 - Continue this process until incidents matching a "First time fix" are found or the pool is exhausted.
3.5.4 - If all "First time fixes" are exhausted, revert to step Y to select a new "Contact type".
3.6 - Pass the filtered list to the next step (M).

4 - Incident Selection and Uniqueness Check (M):

4.1 - From the incidents filtered in step Z:
4.2 - If multiple incidents are available, randomly select one for mapping and conclude XYZM cycle.
4.3 - Ensure the selected incident hasn't been previously assigned to the same agent in prior XYZM cycles.
4.4 - Ensure that the total quota for incidents per agent is met, unless the agent's total incident pool is less than the desired quota. This means if user selected a total of 8 incidents per agent, for example, the XYZM cycle needs to run 8 times per agent, so each agent receives 8 incidents matching as much as possible the configuration sent by the user via the UI. 

Repetition Logic:

- The entire sequence (X, Y, Z, M) is one complete filtering and mapping cycle for each one incident/line/row.
- Based on user input, this sequence might be repeated multiple times for each agent. For instance, if the user wants 5 incidents mapped per agent, the XYZM sequence runs 5 times.
- The sequence may run multiple times for each agent based on user input. For example, if a user requires 5 incidents per agent and there are 50 agents, the sequence runs 250 times in total.

Example of a configuration sent by the UI:

Request body: {
incidentsPerAgent: 10,
incidentConfigs: [
{
service: 'EMEIA Workplace',
contactType: 'Self-service',
ftf: 'FALSE'
},
{
service: 'EMEIA Workplace',
contactType: 'Self-service',
ftf: 'FALSE'
},
{
service: 'Secure Internet Gateway (Global SIG)',
contactType: 'Chat',
ftf: 'RANDOM'
},
{
service: 'Secure Internet Gateway (Global SIG)',
contactType: 'Chat',
ftf: 'RANDOM'
},
{
service: 'Identity and Access Management',
contactType: 'Phone',
ftf: 'TRUE'
},
{
service: 'Identity and Access Management',
contactType: 'Phone',
ftf: 'TRUE'
},
{ service: 'RANDOM', contactType: 'Phone', ftf: 'TRUE' },
{ service: 'RANDOM', contactType: 'Phone', ftf: 'RANDOM' },
{ service: 'RANDOM', contactType: 'Self-service', ftf: 'FALSE' },
{ service: 'RANDOM', contactType: 'RANDOM', ftf: 'RANDOM' }
],
/* SFmembers and agents names omitted */ 
}

Implementation Requirements:

- Modularity: Given the repetition in the logic, encapsulate the filtering process for X, Y, and Z in a standalone function. This function should handle the filtering logic. A separate function or code block will handle the unique requirements of the M step.
- Efficiency: The logic is iterative, so it's crucial to keep performance in mind, especially when dealing with large sets of incidents and agents.
- Functionality: The implementation should be able to handle various configurations sent by the UI dynamically and adapt accordingly.
- Strictly follow this rule: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). It is forbidden to violate this rule.
